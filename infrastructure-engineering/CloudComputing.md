> Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Cloud computing provides different services such as:
- IaaS
- PaaS
- SaaS

**Advantages:**

- Speed and Agility
- It reduces the up-front cost to setup the infrastructure and allows us to focus on applications and business.
- Easy access to resources
- Maintenance All the maintenance work for the resources is done by the provider.
- Multi-tenancy
- Reliability: Resources can be hosted in different Datacenter locations, to provide increased reliability.

## Virtualization
A *hypervisor* sits on top of the host machine's OS. On top of this hypervisor a
VM is created. Hypervisors emulate hardware like CPU, Disk and Network. For ex:
VM Ware, VirtualBox, KVM, etc.

### VMs in development

Vagrant is a tool for managing multiple VMs for the same project. It can also
manage docker containers.
